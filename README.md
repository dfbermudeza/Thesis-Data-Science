The present thesis project aims to predict studentsâ€™ performance on the standardized Colombian test Saber Pro by utilizing socioeconomic status as a predictor and incorporating changes in those conditions over time. To predict the target variable, two types of models were utilized: Decision Tree-based models (including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Decision Tree) and Artificial Neural Network models designed for tabular data (TabNet and NODE). The experiments concluded that Decision Tree-based models outperformed ANN models, exhibiting better performance and requiring less time for training. Additionally, it was discovered that in the case of university education, socioeconomic conditions inherent to the university, such as tuition fees, hold more relative importance than individual socioeconomic status.


The data for this thesis project was acquired from the ICFES open data website through an online request. The obtained data is anonymized. This research did not involve collecting data from human participants or animals. The data owner has released it as open data and holds no legal claim to it.
